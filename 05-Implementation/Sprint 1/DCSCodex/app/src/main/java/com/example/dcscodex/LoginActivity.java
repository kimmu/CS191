* Client Group: Students
* Purpose: This Login Activity class contains the OnLogin method which catches
*          the process of user attempting to log in. This also contains the
*          OpenRegister method which starts the RegisterActivity, which handles user registration in the app
*          whenever the user attempts to register.
